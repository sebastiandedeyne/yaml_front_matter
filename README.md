Parse a file or string containing front matter and a document body. 
  
Front matter is a block of yaml wrapped between two lines containing `---`.
In this example, the front matter contains `title: Hello`, and the body is
`Hello, world`:

```md
---
title: Hello
---
Hello, world
```

After parsing the document, front matter is returned as a map, and the body as
a string.

```elixir
YamlFrontMatter.parse_file "hello_world.md"
{:ok, %{"title" => "Hello"}, "Hello, world"}    
```
